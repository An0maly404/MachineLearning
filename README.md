# Data Exploration and Preprocessing
## Dataset Selection
The dataset used contains the name of the game, the platform, the year of release, the genre, publisher and the sales by region. Those regions are North America, Europe, Japan, Other and the Global sales from everywhere. It also gives the critic score and count of professional critics and of users. Finally, it also contains the developer and rating of the game.

This dataset can be used to see which genre works best in which country, but also to see the best year in video game history by taking into account the critic score and year of release. We can also see which developer are better at which genre by taking the genre, critic score and sales into account. Many patterns can be seen from this dataset.

No "real life" problem can be fixed with this dataset, but since it is a subject that we find interesting, it will be relevant for us.

## Exploration
Choice is the value to see what we want to see. Launching it with a correct choice value with open a new page with the informations on it.

- **Choice 1** is for summary informations such as the mean, the count and many others.
- **Choice 2** is for the missing values and the type of the data. 
- **Choice 3** is to see the data distributions. It doesn't show some informations because they aren"t useful and show nothing interesting.
- **Choice 4** is for visualizing relationship through pairplot and a correclation heatmap.
- Finally, **choice 5** is for the distribution of some of the game by platform, genre and type of rating (the rating isn't a useful feature of this dataset).

## Preprocessing
There are missing values in the dataset, a lot of them is you used "choice = 2", but they all come from one source, which is Nintendo. The dataset doesn't show critic scores associated with Nintendo games, but only them.
